UnderQuake

UnderQuake is a Undermine remake in Quake 2. Make your way through the game while collecting randomly spawned relics and upgrades. Different spawns every time.

Installation: Step 1: Download the repository files. You can do this by clicking the green “<> Code” dropdown and downloading and extracting the ZIP file. Alternatively, you can clone the repository.

Step 2: If you do not own Quake 2 already, get it. I would recommend through steam, making sure to open the game before continuing so the steam key registers (or something I forget). Then, navigate to your Quake 2 Steam folder (library page, settings icon, manage, browse local files). Copy and paste the UnderQuake folder from the repository into the Steam folder.

Step 3: Navigate back to the Quake 2 folder. Find the item called quake2.exe, right click on it, and create a shortcut. Right click this shortcut, click properties, and in the target field after the text, paste " +set game UnderQuake". Hit apply and ok. Launch the game through this shortcut (if you launch it another way and run "set game UnderQuake" in the console, the game may reset the mod config.cfg, which will reset keybinds. If this occurs, copy a new config.cfg file from the repository and paste it into the UnderQuake folder. Then, start up the game on any difficulty you like.

The Game:

Once you spawn, the game functions mostly as normal. All original weapons, ammo, and abilities have been removed from the game and been replaced with Undermine mechanics. 

IT"S DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE! TAKE THIS.
Your weapon is the pickaxe. It has a melee attack (left click) and a ranged throw (right click). While the pickaxe is thrown, you are not able to use your melee attack (cause you threw it dummy). Once the thrown pickaxe hits an enemy or wall, it returns to your hand (kinda like Percy Jackson (KINDA. I know it returns to his pocket not his hand, so pretend you immediately take the pickaxe out of your pocket or something idc))

YOUR COLLECTION OF ROCKS (i mean relics)
As you progress through the game, in place of where weapons normally spawn, you may be lucky enough (its a 1/3 chance) to find yourself a relic (Oooo, shiny). These relics will help boost your damage and survivability throughout your run. The relics and their effects are as follows:

RELICS					DESCRIPTION

Vampirism				Heal 5% of damage dealt
Hyperstone				Increase pickaxe swing rate by 50%
Berserker's Pendant			Deal more damage at lower health
Master Pickaxe				At max health, when pickaxe is swung, also fires a master pickaxe projectile
Ressurection				On a lethal hit, survive with a complimentary 20% heal
Sonic Boom				Increases thrown pickaxe speed by 80%
Dillon's Claw				Increases Crit multiplier by 50%
Shadow's Fang				Increases Crit chance by 50% (so 8% goes to 12%, not 58%)
Hoodie's Pillow				Decreases damage taken by 25%
Large Ember				Causes nearby enemies to be inflicted with minor fire damage 

YOUR COLLECTION OF MAGIC TRICKS (i mean abilities)
Unlike Undermine, you have access to a couple of abilities that can be triggered through your keybinds (if you dont like the keybinds, change them in config.cfg). These abilities, as well as descriptions, are listed below:

ABILITY				DESCRIPTION												KEYBINDS

Thrown Pickaxe			Be able to throw the pickaxe as a ranged attack								"RIGHTMOUSE"
Dash				Quick boost to your speed in the direction faced							"SHIFT"
Critical Hit System		Gives the ability to critical hit for increased damage							NA
Battle Cry			Let out a loud battle cry that increases your damage for a short time					"e"
Arcane Shockwave		Release a burst of magical energy that radiates outward, damaging enemies in a circle around you	"q"

BECOME A BETTER MAGICIAN (i mean upgrade your abilities)
In addition to finding relics throughout the game, in place of where powerups would have been, you have a chance (1/2) to find an ability upgrade, which will give your abilities additional, well, abilities. Here are the upgrades:
